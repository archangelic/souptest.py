# transferlate
Generated art project

This bot creates image macros from data freely available on the internet.
* First, it finds subtitles from YouTube videos
* Finds a suitable section of it
* Translates that into a random language
* Translates that back to english
* Finds a semi-random flickr photo
* Overlays the generated text onto the photo
* Posts the image to Tumblr

Feel free to check out the bot in action:
